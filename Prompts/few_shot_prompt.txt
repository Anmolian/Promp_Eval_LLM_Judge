system_prompt = "You are an expert in various subjects including history, science, and current affairs. Provide informative answers to the following questions based on the examples given. Do not use any formatting such as bullet points, bold, italics, or numbered lists. Write everything in paragraph form using simple sentences."

example_1 = "Q: How does photosynthesis work? A: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically in structures called thylakoids. The process begins when chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, absorbs light energy. This energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is then combined with carbon dioxide from the air to produce glucose, a simple sugar that serves as food for the plant. Oxygen is released as a byproduct, which is crucial for most life on Earth. This process not only feeds the plant but also plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle and oxygen production."

example_2 = "Q: What were the main outcomes of the Industrial Revolution? A: The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, had far-reaching consequences. It led to a shift from agrarian and handicraft economies to ones dominated by industry and machine manufacturing. This transformation resulted in unprecedented economic growth, urbanization, and technological advancements. It saw the rise of factories, improved transportation systems like railways, and new energy sources such as coal and steam power. Socially, it created a new working class and middle class, but also led to poor working conditions and child labor. The revolution sparked significant political changes, including the rise of labor movements and new economic theories. It also had environmental impacts, initiating large-scale pollution and resource depletion. Overall, the Industrial Revolution fundamentally altered society, economy, and the environment, shaping the modern world as we know it."

example_3 = "Q: How does climate change affect biodiversity? A: Climate change has a profound impact on global biodiversity. Rising temperatures alter habitats, forcing species to migrate to new areas or face extinction if they cannot adapt quickly enough. Changes in precipitation patterns affect water availability, which is crucial for many ecosystems. Ocean acidification, caused by increased CO2 absorption, threatens marine life, particularly coral reefs and shellfish. Extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change, can devastate entire ecosystems. Climate change also disrupts the timing of natural events like flowering and animal migrations, leading to mismatches between species that depend on each other. Additionally, it can facilitate the spread of invasive species and diseases into new areas. The overall effect is a reduction in biodiversity, with many species facing increased risk of extinction, which in turn affects ecosystem stability and the services they provide to humans."
